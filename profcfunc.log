Verilog code profile:
   These are split into three categories:
      C++:     Time in non-Verilated C++ code
      Prof:    Time in profile overhead
      VBlock:  Time attributable to a block in a Verilog file and line
      VCommon: Time in a Verilated module, due to all parts of the design
      VLib:    Time in Verilated common libraries, called by the Verilated code
